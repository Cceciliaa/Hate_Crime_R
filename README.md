# Hate Crimes in the U.S. with R Programming
This is a capstone project for a summer program at Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.

In this project, I looked into the data related to the occurrance of hate crimes across the U.S., trying to replicate the previous FiveThirtyEight analysis using updated hate crime data and additional regressors, and explore additional potential influencing factors.

I used R to run the regressions, and used ggplot to generate several visual output.

The final delivery is an HTML file knitted from R-Markdown.
